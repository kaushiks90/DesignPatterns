Intent:
Software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications.

Definition:
The Open Close Principle states that the design and writing of the 
code should be done in a way that new functionality should be added with
minimum changes in the existing code. The design should be done in a way 
to allow the adding of new functionality as new classes,keeping as much as 
possible existing code unchanged.
