The Facade pattern is a simple structure laid over a more complex structure.

The Participants
The Subsystems 
            are any classes or objects which implement functionality but can be "wrapped" or "covered" by the Facade to simplify an interface.
The Facade 
            is the layer of abstraction above the Subsystems, and knows which Subsystem to delegate appropriate work to.

Will I Ever Need This Pattern?
All the damn time. Seriously, the Facade pattern is so general that it applies to almost every major app I've worked on, especially 
those where I couldn't refactor or modify pieces of said apps for various reasons.
