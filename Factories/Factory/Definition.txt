The Factory Method pattern is a Creational pattern which defines an interface for creating an object, 
but doesn't specify what objects the individual implementations of that interface will instantiate.

The Participants
The Product 
            defines the interfaces of objects that the factory method will create.
The ConcreteProduct 
            objects implement the Product interface.
The Creator 
            declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product. 
            The Creator can also define a default implementation of the factory method, though we will not see that in the below example.
The ConcreteCreator 
            objects overrides the factory method to return an instance of a Concrete Product.
